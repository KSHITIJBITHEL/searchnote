## SearchNote
It's a firefox extension that improves the way you browse, by providing intime search and note taking methods.

Have you ever felt the need of jotting down notes while browsing or making to do lists when you accidentally come across some
task while browsing ,then this one's for you..
In this add-on there are 3 prime features- note taking,intime search and quicklinks

**Note Making**

It is the prime feature of this add-on and using it, you can simultaneously store notes consisting of
any text with a title in your sidebar while browsing and further update and delete them.
this feature can be used to take notes, make to do list, using the text of one window/tab in other and many other ways ,which solely depend on you.The notes will persist even when you change the tab or window or even if you close and reopen the browser.(Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+L)

**Quick Links**

Now you're a couple of clicks away from your favourite links ,the popup function is there for you ,where some
of the cool websites are placed for you so that you are just a click away from them (Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+B)

**Intime Search**

By using this feature , you can search for any text on google by just selecting the text and a click to select the search on google option in the context menu ,which will open a new tab with that selected text inserted on google search bar

I mainly used the web storage API to build this extension.

The screenshots of the above functions can be found in the icons folder.

Right now ,it is in temporary form, so to test it ,you have to download it, then in firefox open "about:debugging" and then load temporary extension further uploading the manifest.json file from the searchnote folder and then use it the way you like.
