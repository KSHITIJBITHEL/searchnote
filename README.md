## SearchNote
It's a firefox extension that improves the way you browse, by providing intime search and note taking methods.
In this add-on there are 3 prime features- note taking,intime search and quicklinks

**Note Making**

It is the prime feature of this add-on and using it, one can store any text with a title in his/her sidebar and further update and delete them.
this feature can be used to take notes, make to do list, using the text of one window/tab in other and many other ways ,which solely depend on you.The notes will persist even when you change the tab or window or even if you close and reopen the browser.(Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+L)

**Quick Links**

in this feature ,I've added a few links ,to which you can go on by just pressing a button,the links would be opned in a new tab.(Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+B)

**Intime Search**

By using this feature , you can search for any text on google by just selecting the text and a click to select the search on google option in the context menu ,which will open a new tab with that selected text inserted on google search bar

I mainly used the web storage API to build this extension.

The screenshots of the above functions can be found in the icons folder.
